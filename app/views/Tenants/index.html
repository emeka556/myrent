          The 2004 Residential Tenancies act gives every landlord and tenant a right to a rent
          review once each year.       
      </p>
      <p>
      The Act makes it illegal for a landlord to charge a rent higher than the market rent. 
      </p>
      <p>
      If there is a dispute about the market rent, either the landlord or the tenant can take a case to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (the PTRB).
      </p>
      <p>
      The problem with this system is in establishing an objective way of determining the market rent of a property. 
      <p>
      The purpose of <em>myrent</em> is to gather information on rents from landlords and tenants and allow any registered user to generate a report on the state of the rental market.
      </p>
      <p>      
      The success of the project will depend on the willingness of tenants and landlords to provide information about their properties.
